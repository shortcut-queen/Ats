Installing
----------------------------------------------------------------
1.It is recommended to use the integrated development environment XAMPP. This software is convenient for running php files. The database name is ats. You need to build 12 tables in MySQL. The specific SQL statement is in the file ats.sql. You need to fill in the account name and password pwd. Otherwise, Can not log in;</br>
2.With the integrated development environment XAMPP, it can be directly in place, because it integrates Apache, MySQL, etc.; note that sometimes because the 80 port number may be occupied, affecting the normal operation of the software, you can change to other ports such as 8080 port.</br>
3.Put the system's code folder in XAMPP's localhost folder and run Apache and MySQL in the XAMPP control panel.</br>
